# Overview

The integrated PI3K network model was formulated using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The rate equations and full set of ODEs are given in Tables S1-2. The model construction and calibration processes were implemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks. Inc. 2019a) and the IQM toolbox (http://www.intiquan.com/intiquan-tools/) was used to compile the IQM file for a MEX file which makes the simulation faster.
