# Overview

This page provides supplementary material for the paper "Integrated analysis of the PI3K signalling network uncovers resistance-promoting role of p21WAF1/Cip1 and identifies combination therapies for PIK3CA-driven breast cancer".

The integrated PI3K network model was formulated using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model construction and calibration processes were implemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks. Inc. 2019a) and the IQM toolbox (http://www.intiquan.com/intiquan-tools/) was used to compile the IQM file for a MEX file which makes the simulation faster.
